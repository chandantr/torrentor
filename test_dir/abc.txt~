CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:
Sign and attach the self-work form. Form is here.
The submission directory should have following structure,
   
     rollno-lab8/
                |_ part1

		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)
		|_ part2
		  |_ readme        (usage commands to execute client and server)
		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)
		|_ part3
		  |_ readme        (usage commands to execute client and server)
		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)

Executing each of the task scripts should generate the associated/correct output. 
Required data files, if any, should in the correct directories or specified via path names as part of command-line arguments. 
If the above commands fail to generate your answers, submission will be treated incomplete.
Create a tar.gz file of your submission. The archive should contain the main directory and all sub-directories. 
Name the tar archive yourrollno-lab7.tar.gz. 
Read up the man page for tar.
Upload the tar.gz file on the moodle site for the course.

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:
Sign and attach the self-work form. Form is here.
The submission directory should have following structure,
   
     rollno-lab8/
                |_ part1

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for

deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:
Sign and attach the self-work form. Form is here.
The submission directory should have following structure,
   
     rollno-lab8/
                |_ part1
		  |_ readme        (usage commands to execute client and server)
		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)
		|_ part2
		  |_ readme        (usage commands to execute client and server)
		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)
		|_ part3
		  |_ readme        (usage commands to execute client and server)
		  |_ outputs       (sample runs, show at least three runs and corresponding outputs)

Executing each of the task scripts should generate the associated/correct output. 
Required data files, if any, should in the correct directories or specified via path names as part of command-line arguments. 
If the above commands fail to generate your answers, submission will be treated incomplete.
Create a tar.gz file of your submission. The archive should contain the main directory and all sub-directories. 
Name the tar archive yourrollno-lab7.tar.gz. 
Read up the man page for tar.
Upload the tar.gz file on the moodle site for the course.

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:
Sign and attach the self-work form. Form is here.
The submission directory should have following structure,
   
     rollno-lab8/
                |_ part1

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.

  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.

The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:

CS296 Software Systems Lab (Spring 2012) 
Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
some JAVA classes that you might end up using:
File, RandomAccessFile, Thread, Socket, ServerSocket, DtagramSocket, BufferedReader, InputStreamReader, 
OutputStreamReader, PrintWriter and others.
Part 3: (extra credit) The Multi-Torrentor. 
Make the server multi-client capable. Simultaneously, more than one client can request for 
files from the server. Each requesting for a file and the desired number of the chunks.
As in the previous case (Part 2), each client should receive every chunk on a separate connection.

Submission guidelines:

Lab# 8, networking with java
The objective of this lab to get familarized with Java support for networking and Java threads. 

The introduction to networking slides are here. 

Part 1: Go through the following examples. Understand them, download and try them out.
KnockKnockServer, KnockKnockClient and KnockKnockProtocol. 
KKMultiServer, KKMultiServerThread . 

Code and documentation for these is here. 
Understand logic, usage of networking related classes and methods, download 
and execute. Try out different scenarios for execution.
Part 2: The exercise. Torrentor. 
The assignment is to build a torrentserver and a torrentclient to aid in downloading files by clients from the server. 

Tasks:
A client requests a file to be downloaded from the server and number of chunks
in which the file should be downloaded.
usage: (for client)
$java torrentclient filename numchunks serverIP serverPort
  filename: name of file to be downloaded 
 numchunks: number of chunks/parts in which file should be obtained from server 
  serverIP: IP address of server 
serverPost: listening port for server

usage: (for server) 
$java torrentserver

Client uses this information to open a socket to the server and sends filename and number of parts (#parts in which file will be sent).
Server is waiting on a socket for client requests. 
Server accepts client request and reads in filename and number of chunks (k) information from client. 
e.g., if filea.txt is of size 30,000 bytes and number of chunks is 3, the server must 
deliver the 3 chunks (each of size 10,000 bytes) to the client on three different connections/sockets. 
The server opens (or uses three existing already open) sockets for this.. 
Serve sends port number information for these to the client.
Client receives the k ports numbers (it already knows the server IP address). 
Using the above information, client opens k sockets to connect to the three ports on the server.
Server accepts connections on the k sockets and send the k chunks in parallel.
Client receives all chunks, puts them together and generates the final output file.
Note 1: Both the client and the server need to be multi-threaded.
Note 2: Assume only one client can connect to the server at any time.
Note 3: Assume client asks for text files only.
Outputs
- Requested file at client, identical to one at the server. 
- Print a message (on screen) for each of the following events: 
        * initial connection to server (print client IP, filename and number of chunks 
        * port numbers received by client to be connect for k chunks 
        * port numbers to which socket is bound to for the k sockets used to connect to server 
        * connection establishment message (with client IP and server port number) at server
        * completion message after transmission of each chunk at server
        * completion message after reception of each chunk at chunk
        * file downloaded and put-together message at client
        * print the time required since first file request to server to download complete. also, print avergae download rate in bytes/sec.
